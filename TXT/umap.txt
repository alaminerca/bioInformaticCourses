We are almost at the
point to identify cell subtypes within our
single-cell RNA-seq data. But before proceeding, let's discuss a particular
technique that is extensively used
in the analysis of this type of data,
multidimensional scaling. In our previous video lectures, we have represented our data as a table of numerical values. But it could be
more convenient to have a better graphical
representation of this data. For instance, a
two-dimensional scatter plot where each point represents one sample and the distance between the points reflects their similarity. You may be tempted to say, we do have such a
representation, is the principal
component analysis. Unfortunately, principal
component analysis is not ideal for visualizing
single-cell RNA-seq data. PCA is limited to a linear transformation of a data rotation that we
were discussing before. This is often not enough to uncover hidden
structures and patterns. Class of techniques that has
become more and more popular for representing
single-cell RNA-seq data is multidimensional scaling. Within this class, UMAP is the facto visualization
standard for single-cell data. The operation of multi-dimensional scaling
techniques is in principle, very simple and based
on two main steps. In the first step, the
similarity between each pair of cells is
measured over all genes. The exact way to measure these distances changes depending
on the specific method. In the second step, a scatter plot is created
by placing one dot for each cell and then
spacing the dots according to the distance
computed in the first step. Unfortunately, sometimes
it's not possible to accommodate distances
computed on 20,000 or more dimensions; it's only two
dimensions and which only approximate
solutions are possible. Here is a UMAP that
we can produce using the T-cell data
from our case study. Let's talk more about
UMAPs; what it means. Let's create our
first UMAP plot. In the following coding lecture.
